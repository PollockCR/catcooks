Recipe based off of [Authentic Pad See Ew Recipe – Thai Stir Fried Dark Soy Sauce Noodle Dish](https://www.tastythais.com/pad-see-ew/#imr-recipe) from Tasty Thais

## Ingredients

### Marinade 

- 3 tbsp vegan oyster sauce/mushroom sauce/stir fry sauce
- 1 tbsp soy sauce

### Main Dish

- 18 oz wide flat (sen yai) rice noodles hydrated weight or cooked/soaked dry rice noodles
- 4.5 tbsp dark soy sauce (black soy sauce)/soy sauce+sugar to mix with sen yai
- 8 oz tofu/vegan pork/vegan sausage/pork collar* (1 cup)
- 9 sticks young kale, broccolini and/or Chinese broccoli
- 3 eggs/egg substitute
- 1 tbsp white sugar
- 1 tbsp soy sauce
- 3 tbsp vegan oyster sauce/mushroom sauce/stir fry sauce/*oyster sauce*\*
- 2 tbsp olive oil high smoke point oil
- 3-12 cloves garlic

### Meowmix

- 2 Thai chilis

## Instructions

1. Slice and marinade tofu with oyster sauce and soy sauce, leave to marinate for about 5-10 mins while you prepare the rest of the ingredients.
1. Fist step is marinating the tofu or other protein
1. Mix dark soy sauce with cooked/soaked wide rice noodles and leave to settle & infuse a little.
1. Separate and marinate the noodles
1. Cut the bottom of the kale stems and cut kale leaves in triangle Bring water to a boil and blanch the kale (optional). Set aside
1. Blanch the greens for color (optional)
1. Pound/mince the garlic cloves and add to a little oil in your pan. Stir fry with chilis until fragrant then add in the tofu.
1. Stir fry until the tofu is 70-80% cooked, season with soy sauce, stir to mix and set aside.
1. Heat your pan as hot as possible with a little oil. 
1. Cook the brocollini for a few minutes. Push to side of pan.
1. Crack in two eggs and scramble a few seconds, followed by the marinated noodles. Fold together, breaking up and mixing in the egg as you go.
1. Do not cook too long but do try to spread out the noodles to brown once the egg is mixed in. Toss the noodles over once to stir fry and brown the other side – all of this needs to be done quickly to stop the noodles getting too rubbery from overcooking.
1. As soon as you have browned the noodles add back the tofu and the kale/Chinese broccoli and quickly stir fry to warm through. Serve immediately.

## Notes

- Pad See Ew is typically made with fresh wide rice noodles. If you can get them locally then do but otherwise you can use dried wide noodles or Pad Thai noodles or you can always make homemade wide rice noodles for the ultimate in yummy.
- You need to get everything ready for cooking (mise en place) because once you start there’s no stopping!
- Cook in single batches to make it easier to stop the noodles clumping together and for more even cooking.
